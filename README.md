# PyBer_Analysis

## Overview of the PyBer Analysis: 
The purpose of this project is to use Python and Pandas to create a summary of the ride-sharing data by city type. Then, using Pandas and Matplotlib to create a multiple-line graph that shows the total weekly fares for each city type. Finally, summarizes how the data differs by city type and how those differences can be used by decision-makers at PyBer.

## Results: 
### Deliverable 1: A ride-sharing summary DataFrame by city type
Shows below the summary DataFrame of the differences in ride-sharing data among the different city types. Ride-sharing data include the total rides, total drivers, total fares, average fare per ride and driver, and total fare by city type.

The Urban cities fare is the lowest among the other two city types (Suburban and Rural) but it has the most riders, most drivers and makes most profit.  The total fare for urban is $39,854.38, double the fares of suburban $19,356.33, nine times of rural city type $4,327.92.

### Deliverable 2: A multiple-line chart of total fares for each city type.

In the multiple-line chart of total fares for each city type graph, it shows the rural fare starts around $200 and increases to $500 in April then decreases a little.   The suburban fare starts around $700 and goes up to $1400 and slides down quickly by the end of February then goes back up after the early April.  The urban starts with $1700 and consistently increases to around $2300.  



## Summary
Based on all data results and graphs, we summarize three business recommendations to the CEO for addressing any disparities among the city types.
First, the total fare for the urban city type is the highest and consistent, it is a great opportunity to expand the rides.
Second, the total fare for suburbs is the median between the other two city types (urban and rural).  It is a great opportunity to expand the business by hiring more drivers and lowering the fare. 
Third, the rural city type has the lowest total fare among the suburban and urban city types.  However, there is no overlap on fare for any of the cities.  We can make changes on fare or drivers that will not affect the other city types.
